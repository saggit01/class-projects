/*
   This is a simple arcard game in which the user tries to blow up
   a submarine (a black oval) by dropping depth charges from a
   ship (a blue roundrect).  The user moves the boat with the
   left- and right-arrow keys and drops the depth charge with the
   down-arrow key.
 
   The sub killer applet is based on KeyboardAnimationApplet2, which is
   a framework for applets that display animated action while allowing
   keyboard input from the user to affect the action.  See the file
   KeyboardAnimationApplet2.java for more information.
   
   (Note that the KeyboardAnimationApplet2 class already implements
   KeyListener, FocusListener, and MouseListener.)
